## Project Summary

Our application, Why You Should(nâ€™t) Live In LA, will allow users to visualize the areas where reported crimes occurred in the City of Los Angeles. This will be especially useful for visitors who want to figure out what areas to avoid while exploring the city. Users can also report their own crimes to add to the dataset, allowing our site to be a growing collection of all the available data. The police can update the status of crimes if any progress is made on a case or delete records of a crime if necessary.
